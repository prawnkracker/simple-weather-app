## User Story
A simple weather app that allows users to view weather in different cities. Basic styling for a simple and clean layout. 
Asks users for access to location to get the current weather for their specific location. Also shows other basic information including:
what it actually feels like outside, humidity (%), wind speed (meters/second). 

## Features
Uses both flex and grid layout designs to achieve a nice, clean look. Uses the `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method to 
ask a user if they grant the app access to their location.
